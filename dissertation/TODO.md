* Mention Philippe's work on conservativity somewhere (lifting semantics,
  methodology)
* Look at some of the earlier work form Giorgolo and Asudeh
* Read the whole SEP chapter on Presuppositions
* and van der Sandt 1992
* Gazdar 1979 -- local accommodation as a last resort (sometimes to avoid
  triviality or contradiction)
* $\op{op}.\hsbind$ rule is interesting -> explains projectivity
* Explore a solution to relative clauses that works similarly to the one
  for implicatures.
