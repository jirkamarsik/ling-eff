\section{Confluence}

The object of our study during this section will be the proof of the
\emph{confluence property} of $\banana{\lambda}$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:confluence}
  \demph{Confluence of $\banana{\lambda}$}
  
  Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be terms of $\banana{\lambda}$. If $a \to b$ and $a
  \to c$, then there must exist a term $d$ such that $b \tto d$ and $c \tto
  d$.
\end{theorem}

Proofs of this property are often mechanical and follow the same
pattern. Our strategy will be to reuse a general result which applies one
such proof for a general class of rewriting systems. Our reduction system
is a system of reduction on terms and the reductions have side conditions
concerning the binding of free variables. A good fit for this kind of
system are the Combinatory Reductions Systems (CRSs) of
Klop~\cite{klop1993combinatory}.
